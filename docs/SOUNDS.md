# Sounds: sources and licenses

Every sound the band plays is a free sample set, streamed through [smplr](https://github.com/danigb/smplr) (MIT) from the hosts listed below. Nothing is bundled in this repository. The count-in click is the LinnDrum's side-stick. When a pack fails to load, the instrument falls back to the next one in its chain (`packChain` in `src/audio/packs.ts`).

## Levels

The packs differ by up to 16 dB out of the box, so each one is level-matched:

- Per-instrument volumes (`DEFAULT_VOLUME`) were measured in the browser playing the same line.
- The string pad's two voices sit 9 dB apart (`PAD_VOLUME`), and the harpsichord runs 3 dB over Salamander (`HARPSICHORD_VOLUME`); both were matched on a held note and a line against the trumpet and the grand.
- The electric pianos are normalized about 15 dB hotter than Salamander (C4, mezzo), so they play at `EPIANO_VOLUME`.
- VCSL records its drum layers at their natural level: a snare's softest tap peaks 27 dB under its hardest. smplr also scales by velocity, so each layer is trimmed onto one curve, from −13 dBFS for the softest layer up to −1 dBFS for the hardest. The peaks were measured from the decoded samples and are written next to each piece in `ACOUSTIC_KIT`.

## Held notes

The MIDI.js samples run about three seconds, so a whole note at a slow tempo would cut out. The bowed, blown and held voices load loop points (`SUSTAINED` and `loopSource` in `src/audio/packs.ts`): MusyngKite first, FluidR3 as the fallback, each with its own loops. The string pad and the choir have no published loops; `scripts/soundfont-loops.py` decodes each note, finds the sustain from the envelope, and picks a rising zero crossing at each end whose waveform matches. Rerun it (macOS, needs `afconvert`) if a sample set changes.

## Notation fonts

The chart is engraved by VexFlow in Petaluma and Petaluma Script (Steinberg's handwritten SMuFL fonts, SIL Open Font License 1.1). `public/fonts/petaluma.woff2` and `petaluma-script.woff2` are the files VexFlow 5 bundles, extracted so the page loads `vexflow/core` and these two instead of the full entry's six inlined fonts. If they don't load, the full entry is fetched and the chart falls back to Bravura and Academico.

## Gaps in the hosted sets

The hosted CP80 is missing three oggs (`057-A3-F`, `065-F4-PP`, `080-G#5-MP`), and the Wurlitzer's `ab6mp.ogg` won't decode. smplr plays silence for a region with no sample. The m4a twins aren't a reliable stand-in, because many of them don't decode in Chromium. So `EPIANO_GAPS` fetches the same note one velocity layer over instead.

## Adding a sound

Only add samples with a license that allows free use and redistribution: CC0, public domain, CC BY or CC BY-SA. Add the set to this table and to the credit line in `src/app/page.tsx`. Level-match it against the pack it sits beside before you make it a default.
